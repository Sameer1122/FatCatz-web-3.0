            Each Fat Catz is unique and carefully selected to represent our
            movement. Fat Catz are algorithmically generated from over 250
            traits such as clothing, hair style, eye expression and more. All
            Fat Catz are cool and ready to be stars, but some are rarer and more
            unique than others.

            Fat Catz are ready for great collaborations with artists platform
            and brands, holders will be able to join exclusive drops, collab
            auctions and events.
          </li>
          <li>
            The team is committed to build an ever expanding interactive
            experience with NFT integration, fun activities, community content
            and amazing partnership.
          </li>
          <li>
            Holding a Fat Catz allows you to participate in coordinating the Fat
            Community Treasury. Holders can vote for experiences, activations
            and campaigns that benefit the Fat Catz.
          </li>

            The creation of a graphic novel/comic book we think is a great
            opportunity to fix Fat Catz forever in the popular imagination. Each
            Fat Catz holder will have the opportunity to submit personalised
            backstories for their characters, to be included in the future Fat
            Catz story. The protagonists of the comic book will be chosen by the
            community. The next hero could be your Fat Catz!
